An Accounts Package written as a learning exercise (isn't it always?)

Specific things I plan to learn:
	F# - plan to model the domain and write tests in F#. Possibly use it for almost everything - we'll see
	Caliburn Micro to do the graphics framework
	TickSpec - use it to do BDD for the user stories I come up with

If I need them I want to experiment more with
	SimpleInjector - if I need IoC DI stuff, I'd like to use this one
	NSubstitute or Foq - for mocking

I'm building on the efforts I'd made previously but planning to do things a little differently.
